    "ELU can be useful for deep neural networks, leaky ReLU can be useful\n",

    "\n",
    "Three ways to produce a sparse model are: 1) L1 regularization, which\n",
    "encourages weights to be exactly 0, 2) dropout, which randomly sets some\n",
    "neurons to 0 during training, and 3) weight sharing, which constrains\n",

    "Dropout can slow down training because it adds computational overhead\n",
    "and requires more iterations to converge, but it can also prevent\n",
