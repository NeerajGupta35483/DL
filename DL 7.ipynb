    "Applications for a sequence-to-sequence RNN include machine translation,\n",
    "speech recognition, and video captioning. A sequence-to-vector RNN can\n",
    "be used for sentiment analysis and image captioning, while a\n",

    "each dimension represent? What about its outputs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs of an RNN layer must have at least two dimensions: the batch\n",
    "size and the sequence length. Each dimension represents a different\n",
    "aspect of the input data. The outputs of an RNN layer also have at least\n",
    "two dimensions, but the last dimension may represent different things\n",

    "The main difficulties when training RNNs include vanishing gradients,\n",

    "The LSTM cell architecture consists of a cell state, an input gate, a\n",
