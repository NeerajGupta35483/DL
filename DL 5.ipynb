    "1. Why would you want to use the Data API?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data API provides a high-performance, flexible input pipeline for\n",
    "TensorFlow models, allowing for efficient loading, preprocessing, and\n",
    "augmentation of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What are the benefits of splitting a large dataset into multiple\n",
    "files?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting a large dataset into multiple files allows for parallel\n",
    "loading and processing, reducing the time spent waiting for data to be\n",
    "loaded and allowing for more efficient use of available hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. During training, how can you tell that your input pipeline is the\n",
    "bottleneck? What can you do to fix it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A slow input pipeline can be identified by monitoring the GPU and CPU\n",
    "utilization during training. To fix it, you can use techniques such as\n",
    "prefetching, parallel interleave, and caching to optimize the pipeline\n",
    "and reduce wait times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Can you save any binary data to a TFRecord file, or only serialized\n",
    "protocol buffers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Only serialized protocol buffers can be saved to a TFRecord file, but\n",
    "this format can be used to store a wide range of data types, including\n",
    "images, audio, and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Why would you go through the hassle of converting all your data to\n",
    "the Example protobuf format? Why not use your own protobuf definition?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting data to the Example protobuf format provides a standardized,\n",
    "efficient way to store and process data within TensorFlow models,\n",
    "reducing the risk of errors and ensuring compatibility across platforms\n",
    "and environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. When using TFRecords, when would you want to activate compression?\n",
    "Why not do it systematically?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compression should be activated when the benefits in reduced storage and\n",
    "increased data transfer speed outweigh the overhead costs of\n",
    "decompression, and when the type of data being compressed is suitable\n",
    "for compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Data can be preprocessed directly when writing the data files, or\n",
    "within the tf.data pipeline, or in preprocessing layers within your\n",
    "model, or using TF Transform. Can you list a few pros and cons of each\n",
    "option?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing data at different stages offers different trade-offs in\n",
    "terms of complexity, flexibility, and performance. Preprocessing data\n",
    "directly when writing data files offers efficiency and simplicity, while\n",
    "preprocessing in the tf.data pipeline offers more flexibility and\n",
    "control over data augmentation. Preprocessing within a model using\n",
    "preprocessing layers offers greater control over the model's behavior,\n",
    "while using TF Transform offers advanced preprocessing capabilities and\n",
    "the ability to handle very large datasets."
