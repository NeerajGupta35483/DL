    "\n",
    "An artificial neuron, also known as a perceptron, is a computational\n",
    "unit that takes in several inputs, processes them, and produces an\n",
    "output. It consists of three main components: inputs, weights, and an\n",
    "activation function. The inputs are weighted, and then the sum is passed\n",
    "through an activation function to produce the output. This is similar to\n",
    "how a biological neuron receives and processes inputs through dendrites,\n",
    "and sends out an output signal through an axon. However, artificial\n",
    "neurons are much simpler in structure than biological neurons.\n",

    "ReLU function: The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function sets all\n",
    "negative inputs to zero and maps all positive inputs to their own value.\n",
    "It is the most commonly used activation function in deep learning models\n",
    "because it is computationally efficient and does not suffer from the\n",
    "vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tanh function: The tanh function is similar to the sigmoid function but\n",
    "maps inputs to a range between -1 and 1. It is commonly used in the\n",
    "hidden layers of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax function: The softmax function is used in the output layer of\n",
