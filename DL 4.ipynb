    "1. How would you describe TensorFlow in a short sentence? What are its\n",
    "main features? Can you name other popular Deep Learning libraries?**\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is a popular open-source Deep Learning library that offers\n",
    "various tools and features for developing, training, and deploying\n",
    "machine learning models. Its main features include a flexible\n",
    "architecture, efficient data processing, and distributed computing\n",
    "capabilities. Other popular Deep Learning libraries include PyTorch,\n",
    "Keras, and Caffe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Is TensorFlow a drop-in replacement for NumPy? What are the main\n",
    "differences between the two?**\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is not a drop-in replacement for NumPy, as it offers more\n",
    "advanced features for developing and training machine learning models.\n",
    "While both libraries offer similar functionalities for handling\n",
    "numerical data, TensorFlow is specifically designed for building and\n",
    "training complex machine learning models, whereas NumPy is a\n",
    "general-purpose numerical computing library.\n",

    "**3. Do you get the same result\n",
    "with tf.range(10) and tf.constant(np.arange(10))?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No, you do not get the same result with tf.range(10) and\n",
    "tf.constant(np.arange(10)), as the former returns a Tensor of integers\n",
    "from 0 to 9, while the latter returns a Tensor of floating-point numbers\n",
    "from 0.0 to 9.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Can you name six other data structures available in TensorFlow,\n",
    "beyond regular tensors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Other data structures available in TensorFlow include SparseTensor,\n",
    "RaggedTensor, Dataset, FeatureColumn, Estimator, and SavedModel.\n",

    "**5. A custom loss function can be defined by writing a function or by\n",
    "subclassing the keras.losses.Loss class. When would you use each\n",
    "option?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a custom loss function using a function is appropriate for\n",
    "simple, one-off use cases, while subclassing the keras.losses.Loss class\n",

    "**7. When should you create a custom layer versus a custom model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom layers are suitable for adding custom functionality to existing\n",
    "models or creating complex layers that can be reused across multiple\n",
    "models. Custom models are suitable for more complex model architectures\n",
    "or for situations where the built-in Keras models do not fit the\n",
    "requirements of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. What are some use cases that require writing your own custom\n",

    "Custom training loops are useful in scenarios where more fine-grained\n",

    "that they should follow specific rules for defining and executing the\n",

    "The main rules for a function to be convertible to a TF Function include\n",
    "using TensorFlow operations and functions, avoiding operations with side\n",
    "effects, avoiding control flow statements, and avoiding complex Python\n",
    "data types.\n",

    "that? Why not make all your models dynamic?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Keras models are required when the architecture of the model\n",
    "depends on the input data, such as in recurrent neural networks or\n",
    "models with variable-length inputs. Dynamic models can be created using\n",
    "the Functional API or by subclassing the keras.Model class. However, not\n",
    "all models require dynamic behavior, as static models offer better\n",
    "performance and are easier to optimize."
